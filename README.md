# Hello, world! 🌍

Welcome to reopened GitHub Repo, combining my previous work over at SMDX.

**LATEST PROJECT HERE: here**

---

## Old Repositories Satus:

**NOTE:** This includes only a few of the most popular ones, although my new ones are far more enjoyable and practical.

# Aurelia Executor (100% sUNC)

- **STATUS**: 🟡 <mark>Work in Progress 🔨</mark> 
  
  Working to get Aurelia back, fixes will include:
  
  - [x]  **Removal of database (offline mode)**
  
  - [x]  **Fixed offsets for latest release**
  
  - [x]  **Integrated Script Hub**
  
  - [x]  **Custom theme support**



# YouTube Vanilla AdBlocker

- **STATUS**: 🟡 <mark>Work in Progress 🔨</mark>
  
  Due to the method being patched, it needs to be reworked entirely. Many alternatives exist, so this is low priority. I am also unaware of the ad injection hook.
  
  - [x] **Fix**
  
  - [x] **Does not rely on TamperMonkey**
  
  - [x] **Custom playback speed**
  
  - [x] **Keybinds**
